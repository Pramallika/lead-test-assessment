# 🏨 Shady Meadows B&B – Lead Test Engineer Assessment

This project represents a functional and non-functional test automation solution for the **Shady Meadows B&B** website, designed as part of a Lead Test Engineer assessment.

It showcases a complete QA strategy, exploratory testing documentation, modular Playwright automation framework, and professional engineering leadership practices.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- ✅ Define and implement a scalable automation solution using Playwright + TypeScript
- ✅ Cover both **functional** and **non-functional** aspects of testing
- ✅ Demonstrate **leadership** through test strategy, documentation, and sustainable practices
- ✅ Align with industry standards in CI/CD readiness, bug reporting, and test design
- ✅ Deliver clean, modular, and maintainable code and artifacts

## 🧪 Automation Overview

- ✅ Framework: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with TypeScript  
- ✅ Structure: Page Object Model (POM)  
- ✅ Status: Core flows automated (homepage, contact form, admin login)  
- ⚠️ Known Bugs: Some flows skipped using `test.fixme()` to avoid flaky CI results  
- 📊 Report: Playwright HTML report generated after each test run  
- 📦 CI/CD: GitHub Actions integration ready (planned)

---

## 📑 Key Highlights

- 📘 Exploratory testing backed by structured documentation  
- ⚙️ Scalable, modular codebase using best practices in test design  
- 🔍 Functional and non-functional testing scope clearly defined  
- 🚧 Known issues documented transparently  
- 📈 Clear future roadmap: accessibility checks, API and performance testing  
- 🧭 Leadership mindset: onboarding guides, Confluence structure, collaboration actions

## 🙌 Assessment Statement

This repository is part of a **technical assessment** for a Lead Test Engineer role and was built from scratch, showcasing not only test coverage but strategic thinking, leadership readiness, and documentation quality.

All automation was designed based on manual exploration, analysis, and prioritization — aligning with industry best practices for sustainable QA.
